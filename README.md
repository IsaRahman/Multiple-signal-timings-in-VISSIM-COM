# Multiple-signal-timings-in-VISSIM-COM
Analyzing the performance of traffic under different signal timings is necessary, but there is no default option available to run the simulation multiple times with different phase and signal timings in VISSIM. That is why, initiating the code stepwise with various data set of signal timing can help getting multiple runs automatically.
